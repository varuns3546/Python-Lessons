# This is a print statement:

print("Hello, world!")

# This outputs the text "Hello, world!" to the console.

# Code is ran top to bottom so the following line will run after the previous print statement

print("My name is Bob.")

# Right click the file "01_welcome.py" and open in Integrated Terminal.
# To see the output, in the terminal type in the command: python 01_welcome.py

# Now replace the second print statement with whatever text you like. Rerun the code and see the output.
